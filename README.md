Takes photos and geotracks, combines them with beautiful filenames. This for CANON.

OK, this is not rocket science. This tool does someting I need very often with my Canon Camera.

1. The camera generates images depending of there working mode. While some modes use the prefix IMG (which I like) others use _MG (which I hate). This tool renames everything to IMG.
2. Put multiple gpx or kml files into the folder, and the geocoordinates are applied to the image files.
3. Hint: If you use an Android smartphone, Google is tracking you. Use this data to geotag your photos! Go to: https://maps.google.com/locationhistory and download a KML file.

Requirements:<br>
