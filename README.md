A collection of tools. It takes photos and geotracks, combines them, renames them to beautiful filenames. This works for my CANON â€” feel free to add value.

OK, this is not rocket science. This tool does someting I need very often with my Canon Camera.

1. The camera generates images depending of there working mode. While some modes use the prefix IMG (which I like) others use _MG (which I hate). This tool renames everything to IMG.
2. Put multiple gpx or kml files into the folder, and the geocoordinates are applied to the image files.
3. Hint: If you use an Android smartphone, Google is tracking you. Use this data to geotag your photos! Go to: https://maps.google.com/locationhistory and download a KML file.
4. Even better: Let the Tagger download your locations from Google and apply them (See link to blogpost below)

Requirements:<br>
Install exiftool.
For automatically download geodata from Google: A cookie file.

Credits go to Terence Eden for describing how to liberate your Google Location Data and listening me explaining it doesn't work for me. It did. Later.
